# Project2_Machine-Learning
## Machine Learning Project_Data Science (Fusionex Data Science Programme)

## Overview (Section A and B)
Company A is starting their initiatives into the new age of Data Analytics. To start things off, they collected some data on their current employees, with information to help them understand more about their own employees

Act as a Data Scientist to analyze the above dataset for the company, to conduct the below tasks using your knowledge and skill in Machine Learning.

### Sections A and B Dataset
Dataset: exam_dataset.csv (company A employee data)

Fields in the dataset: Age,BusinessTravel, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, Bonus, Department, DistanceFromHome, Education, EducationField, EmployeeCount, EmployeeNumber, EnvironmentSatisfaction, Gender, JobLevel, JobRole, MaritalStatus,PerformanceRating, StockOptionLevel, TrainingTimesLastYear, WorkLifeBalance, YearsAtCompany, YearsSinceLastPromotion, OverTime, Attrition

### Tutorial_1:
### Section A) Conduct simple data exploration and data analysis on the given dataset

  - Step 1: Display the number of attributes available in the dataset

  - Step 2: Find the dimension number of this dataset              
              
  - Step 3: Display the average of these attributes: ‘Age’, ‘Monthly Income’ and ‘Years at Company’. Round the answers to 2 decimal places

  - Step 4: Find the minimum and maximum ‘Monthly Income’

  - Step 5: Provide graphical visualization by plotting Histogram of ‘Monthly Income vs staff numbers’

  - Step 6: Provide graphical Visualization of the distribution between ‘Year at Company’ and ‘Monthly Income’ using the scatter plot

  - Step 7: Find the correlation between ‘Years at Company’ and ‘Monthly Income’

  - Step 8: Based on the findings: <br>
      a) Range of monthly income at Company A <br>
      b) Most and Least Frequent monthly income values at Company A <br>
      c) Observation on the distribution of monthly income values <br>
      d) Linear relationship between monthly income and employees’ individual years at the company A 

### Section B) Classification using Naïve Bayes for: ‘Age’, ‘BusinessTravel’, ‘MonthlyIncome’ and ‘JobSatisfaction’ to predict ‘Attrition’

  - Step 1: Import necessary libraries

  - Step 2: Import dataset (exam_dataset.csv)

  - Step 3: Allocate the relevant attributes as input and output

  - Step 4: Use LabelEncoder to encode categorical data

  - Step 5: Split the data into training and test sets with the appropriate proportions

  - Step 6: Normalized the data using StandardScaler

  - Step 7: Fit the and predict results using the Naïve Bayes Classifier

  - Step 8: Evaluate the results using confusion matrix and calculate the prediction accuracy

  - Step 9: Discuss the results and findings

    

## Overview (Section C)
Perform clustering comparison between two techniques: K-Means and DBSCAN.

The aim is to assess which is the more suitable method for this given dataset.

### Section C Dataset
Dataset: clustering.csv

Fields in the dataset: A and B

### Tutorial_2:
### Section C) Clustering comparison between K-Means and DBSCAN

 - Step 1: Perform K-Means clustering (use WCSS to help find best K value) on the given dataset, display clustering results with graphical visualization, provide any relevant comments and discussions.

 - Step 2: Perform DBSCAN clustering (use knee locator to help find optimal parameter) on the given dataset, display clustering results with graphical visualization, provide relevant comments and discussions.

 - Step 3: Conduct comparison studies on the two techniques (K-Means and DBSCAN), with graphical visualization comparisons, discuss the results to decide on whether: <br>
     a) K-Means is the better clustering technique for this dataset or, <br>
     b) DBSCAN is the better clustering technique for this dataset, or <br>
     c) There’s no clear distinction between the two techniques for this dataset
